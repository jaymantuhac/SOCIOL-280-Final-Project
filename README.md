# SOCIOL-280-Final-Project

The following repo contains materials and code used in my final project for SOCIOL 280  (Analysis of Social Network Data) at UC Irvine (Fall Quarter 2021). In this project, I was interested in looking at the infleunce that zip code has on modeling a simulated COVID-19 outbreak. Using a dummy network dataset from Microbe Trace (Centers for Disease Control), I was able to model whether or not the disease transmission network demonstrates a homophilous relationship based on zip code.
